# **ðŸ“§ Phishing Email Detection Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
ðŸš€ **Classifying Emails as Phishing or Legitimate using SimpleRNN in TensorFlow/Keras**  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using SimpleRNN** to classify emails as either **phishing** (fraudulent) or **legitimate** based on their textual content. The model processes email text **sequentially**, learning relationships between words to identify potential phishing attacks.

This notebook covers:
âœ… **Preprocessing email text** (Tokenization, Padding, Cleaning)  
âœ… **Building an RNN Model with SimpleRNN**  
âœ… **Training and Evaluating the Model**  
âœ… **Improving Performance with Dropout & Regularization**
